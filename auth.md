## 🛠️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravirajbhardwaj/authentication.git
cd authentication
```

---

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

### 3. Set up environment variables

This project requires setting up environment variables and generating key pairs for authentication.

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Create a `secrets` directory at the root of the project:

```bash
mkdir secrets
```

---

3. Inside the `secrets` directory, create two files:

- `private.pem`: This will store the private key.
- `public.pem`: This will store the public key.

4. Generate a public and private key pair. You can use the following command to generate them:
   ✅ 1. Generate Private Key (private.pem)

   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.pem -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048
   ```

   - -algorithm RSA → We are using RSA algorithm.
   - rsa_keygen_bits:2048 → Sets key size to 2048 bits (standard secure size).
   - This generates `private.pem`.
   - The private key is used to sign the JWTs, ensuring that only the server can create valid tokens.
   - The private key should be kept secret and secure, as it is used to sign the JWTs.

   ✅ 2. Extract Public Key (public.pem) from Private Key

   ```bash
   openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem
   ```

   - -pubout → Extracts the public key from the private key.
   - -in private.pem → Specifies the input file (private key).
   - -out public.pem → Specifies the output file (public key).
   - This generates `public.pem`.
   - The public key is derived from the private key, allowing you to share it without compromising security.
   - The private key should be kept secret and secure, while the public key can be shared with anyone who needs to verify the JWTs signed with the private key.
   - The public key is used to verify the JWTs, ensuring that they were signed by the server and have not been tampered with.

---

5. Use the following commands to run the project:

   Development mode

   ```bash
   pnpm run dev
   ```

   Production mode

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```
