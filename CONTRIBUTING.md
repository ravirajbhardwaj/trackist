## Guidelines for Contribution <a name="contribution-guidelines"></a>

Here's a guide on how you can effectively contribute to our Trackist:

1. Pull Requests for Readme Updates: Please refrain from sending pull requests solely for updating the project's readme file. While we appreciate the importance of clear and concise documentation, we prefer to focus on substantial code contributions and feature enhancements.

2. Grammar Updates: Our team values effective communication, but we're not grammar sticklers. You don't need to send pull requests solely for grammar fixes or minor language improvements. Instead, concentrate on the core functionalities and features of the project.
